# Novel-Corona-Virus-COVID-19-Analysis
A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is any recently discovered coronavirus of medical significance not yet permanently named.
Although coronaviruses are endemic in humans and infections are normally mild(such as the common cold, which is caused by human coronaviruses in about 15% of cases),cross-species transmission has produced some unusually virulent strains which can cause viral pneumonia and in serious cases even acute respiratory distress syndrome.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install these libraries
```bash
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install plotly
pip install folium
```
# Numpy
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:
1. A powerful N-dimensional array object.
2. Sophisticated (broadcasting) functions.
3. Tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code.
4. Useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities.

# Pandas
Pandas is an opensource library that allows to you perform data manipulation in Python.
Pandas library is built on top of Numpy, meaning Pandas needs Numpy to operate.
Pandas provide an easy way to create, manipulate and wrangle the data.
Pandas is also an elegant solution for time series data.

# Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.
It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, Qt, etc.

# Seaborn
Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python.
It is built on top of matplotlib and closely integrated with pandas data structures.

# Plotly
The plotly Python library (plotly.py) is an interactive,plotting library that supports over 40 unique chart types covering a wide range of statistical, financial, geographic, scientific, and 3-dimensional use-cases.
Built on top of the Plotly JavaScript library (plotly).

# Folium
folium builds on the data wrangling strengths of the Python ecosystem and the mapping strengths of the leaflet.js library.
Manipulate your data in Python, then visualize it in on a Leaflet map via folium.
